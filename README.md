# BoltPass

BoltPass is my A-Level Computer Science NEA (Non-Examinable Assessment) project

It is a simple password manager that makes use of AES-256 encryption alongside PBKDF2 to encrypt users' passwords. It provides functionality such as email verification, password changing and 2 factor authentication used time-based one time passcode (TOTP).
